# README

This README file provides instructions on how to start the GPT API (a Django project) and the Next.js project.

## GPT API (Django project)

To start the GPT API, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) to isolate the project's dependencies from other Python projects.

3. Navigate to the project directory and activate the virtual environment by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver
```


## Next.js project

To start the Next.js project, ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. If not, download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

Follow these steps to run the Next.js project:

1. Navigate to the Next.js project directory using the terminal.

2. Install the required Node.js packages by running:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Next.js project should now be running, and you can access it in your web browser at http://localhost:3000/.
